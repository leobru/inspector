 INSPECTOR
 =========
 
In the early 1980s, there was a little puzzle game on a Soviet mainframe, called "Inspector", written in Pascal.

Its description stated that it was "translated and adapted", presumably from a game written in BASIC 
and published in one of the Western computer magazines received by State Public Library for Scientific and Technical Literature (ГПНТБ),
likely "BYTE", "Datamation" or some such, no later than 1985. 
It could have been either a U.S. or a British magazine, much less likely French or German,
if there were any that published programs to type in. 

But, everything is possible.

[I've asked a question on the StackExchange Retrocomputing forum](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/q/1908/4025), 
but no one has recognized the game by description, or by a sample session,
after I'd written my best recollection of it in C++. So here it is, maybe someone someday will recognize it.

Just say "make inspector".
